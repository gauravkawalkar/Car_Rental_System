# Car_Rental_System:-
A Car Rental System built in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This system simulates the operations of a car rental service, allowing users to rent cars, view available cars, and manage their rentals.

Description:-
The Car Rental System is a simple Java application that simulates the process of renting cars. It provides functionality for customers to view available cars, rent cars, return cars, and check rental history. The system utilizes OOP principles such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction to manage the data and operations efficiently.

Functionalities:-
1.Rent a car
2.Return a car

Features:-
1.Encapsulation: The Car objects encapsulate car details, ensuring data integrity.
2.Inheritance: Different types of cars, inherit from a base class Car.
3.Polymorphism: The system supports different rental rates and actions for different car types.
4.Abstraction: Interfaces and abstract classes abstract complex rental processes and car features.

Technologies Used:-
1.Java: The core language for building the application.
2.OOP: Using object-oriented principles to create a modular and scalable system.
3.Collections: Java collections (e.g., List, Map) are used to store and manage cars and rental data.
